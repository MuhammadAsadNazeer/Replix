**<h2>Case Sensitive</h2>**</br>
This decides if the search pays attention to big and small letters. For example, do "Cat" and "cat" count as the same, or are they different?</br></br>
If **"Case Sensitive" is Checked** The search will only match the same letters, big or small. For example, if you search for "Cat," it will not find "cat."</br></br>
If **"Case Sensitive" is Unchecked** The search doesnâ€™t care about big or small letters. It will treat "Cat," "cat," or even "CAT" as the same thing.</br></br>
This is useful when you need to be extra careful about how things are written, like in computer programming or if you're following special rules.</br></br>
**<h2>Search Content</h2>**</br>
This decides if the search will look inside files or just at the names of files and folders.</br></br>
If **"Search Content" is Checked** The search looks through all the words written inside the files to find and replace the ones you choose.</br></br>
If **"Search Content" is Unchecked** It skips looking inside files and only checks the names of files or folders (if you want to rename them).</br></br>
This gives you the choice to either focus on file names or dive into the actual text inside files.</br></br>
**<h2>Occurrences</h2>**
This tells you how many times your search word shows up and gets replaced.</br></br>
**How it works:**</br></br>
After the search is done, it will count and show you how many matches it found.</br></br> For example, if you searched for "apple," it might say "12 matches found," meaning "apple" was replaced 12 times in total.</br></br>
This helps you keep track of how much your changes affected everything.</br></br>
